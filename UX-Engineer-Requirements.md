# UX Engineer Requirements

1. On page load, make a request to a list endpoint (of your choice) and render the resulting dog photos.
2. Each photo should be accompanied by the following UI elements:
   - A button to "like" the dog
   - A button to "hide" the dog (this should hide the photo)
   - A button to "expand" the dog (this should open a modal that displays the photo at a larger size)
   - For both "liking" and "hiding," the user's choices do not need to persist across sessions, but should be tracked until the user exits the page
3. The user should be able to toggle between viewing thumbnail versions of the photos and seeing them at their actual proportions (not necessarily actual _sizes_).

Beyond all of these requirements, the page should look both beautiful and usable. We'll evaluate your response not only on the code you write, but also on:

- Your design choices (typography, layout, hierarchy, color palette, etc.)
- How accessible the site is (keyboard navigation, ARIA tags, etc.)

While you don't have to optimize for a mobile/touch device, the page should be responsive and scale to any screen size.
