# ISL Dogs: An Assignment for You!

Hi there! We're really glad you're here &mdash; if you're reading this, it means that we've enjoyed talking with you and are excited to move forward with this process.

This is a **brief but open-ended** code challenge meant to get a better sense of your front-end development skills in a hands-on environment. **Please don't spend more than four hours on this.** We're not looking for perfection, but want to be able to see your thought process and how you approach problems.

## Overview

We'd like to build a site that uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch (ha!) and display photos of dogs. It should also allow the user to filter dogs by type (i.e. Chihuahua, Boxer, Terrier) &mdash; you should use the Dog API's [JSON endpoint](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/) to get the data for the list in order to display it.

There are two sets of requirements, and you should have been told earlier which one is your assignment. If you take on any of the requirements from the other set, please make note of it (see "Finishing Up" below).

### [JavaScript Engineer Requirements &rarr;](JS-Engineer-Requirements.md)

## Installation

Clone this repo, `cd` into the directory, and then:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

^^ _Note:_ The app is a very simple Express.js back-end. No knowledge of Express is required, but you do need to install it. _If you have any questions or issues with the installation process, please let us know right away! We do not want any environment issues to get in the way of the challenge._

Once you run the above commands, visit `http://localhost:3000` in the browser of your choosing to see the site running locally.

The main files you'll be working with are:

```
index.html
static/style.css
script.js
```

When you make changes to any of these files, you should refresh the browser to see them.

Outside of Google Fonts, there are no external dependencies. We encourage you to keep it that way and stick to vanilla JS and CSS! If you decide to add a library or framework, please make note of what it is and why you're using it.

## Finishing Up

Edit `NOTES.md` and describe the work you did (which features you implemented), and anything else you want us to know about your thought process and general strategy. Then, once you're all done, ZIP up the directory, and send it to us as an attachment in an email.

Thank you for reading this far, thank you for your interest in this position, and thank you again for your time! We are so excited to see what you come up with ðŸŒ±.
