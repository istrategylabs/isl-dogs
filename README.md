# ISL Dogs: An Assignment for You!

Hi there! We're really glad you're here &mdash; if you're reading this, it means that we've enjoyed talking with you and based on what we've heard so far, think you could make a wonderful addition to our team.

This is a **brief but open-ended** code challenge meant to get a better sense of your front-end development skills in a hands-on environment. **Please don't spend more than two hours on this.** We're not looking for perfection, but want to be able to see your thought process and how you approach problems.

## Overview

This single-page site uses the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch (ha!) photos of dogs and display them. Only, it's not working right now ðŸ˜ž. At a bare minimum, we're hoping you can fix some of the bugs in the code and make it functional.

Beyond that, the client (us) has some features for you to implement. Please work on **at most three** of the following:

1. **Layout** &mdash; What might be a better layout for the photos than we have now? Some ideas:
    - Horizontally and vertically centering the photos in their container
    - Creating a horizontally scrolling, single-row layout
    - Making the photos responsive to screen size
2. **Other types of dogs** &mdash; The [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) also has endpoints for other types of dogs (i.e. Chihuahua, Boxer, Terrier). Implement a way to update the view so the user can choose whether to view all dogs or specific types.
3. **Load more dogs** &mdash; The site is hard-coded to show 10 random dogs on page load. Implement a way for the user to load more (and perhaps specificy how many they would like to see).
4. **Accessibility** &mdash; The experience of this site could be better for users with different devices and abilities. Improve the site's accessibility.
5. **`Like` and `dislike` dogs** &mdash; Implement a way for a user to `like` or `dislike` a dog and display this visually. It does not have to persist (i.e. in cookies or other storage).
6. **Animations** &mdash; Along with other features, implement animations for actions such as loading content from the API or liking/disliking.
7. **Sharing** &mdash; Implement a way for a user to share a dog (to the network(s)) of your choosing, as well as share the entire site.

## Installation

Clone this repo, `cd` into the directory, and then:
```
npm install
npm run start
```
^^ _Note:_ The app is a very simple Express.js back-end. No knowledge of Express is required.

Once you run the above scripts, visit `http://localhost:3000` in the browser of your choosing to see the site running locally.

The main files you'll be working with are:
```
index.html
static/style.css
script.js
```

Outside of Google Fonts, there are no external dependencies. We encourage you to keep it that way and stick to vanilla JS and CSS! If you decide to add a library or framework, please make note of what it is and why you're using it.

## Finishing Up

Commit your changes back to this repo, and send us an email when you're finished. Edit `NOTES.md` and describe the work you did (which features you implemented), and anything else you want us to know about your thought process and general strategy.

Thank you for reading this far, thank you for your interest in this position, and thank you again for your time! We are so excited to see what you come up with ðŸŒ±.
